                    Infinite Mile LLC was an award-winning journal of art and culture(s) in Detroit, Michigan that published monthly online issues and annual print anthologies.

                            Despite having an active art community, no journals covered art and culture(s) in Detroit, Michigan from Detroit.  
                            As a result, the art community in Detroit did not have a platform from which it could voice issues affecting the community.

                            Detroit, Michigan needed a monthly, web-based journal of art and culture(s) to voice issues affecting the Detroit art community.  
                            The journal would have to bridge demographic groups in a very segregated region by class and race.

                            Rapid iterations of logo and name ideas were shared amongst stakeholders.  
                            The process was one of the best I&#39;ve seen, with stakeholders working together to find the best design solution instead of defending their own ideas.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Once the name and logo were decided, I began sketching ideas for the Infinite Mile website.  Stakeholders agreed to use a custom website because the website needed to have a different look than all the rest of the websites and have strong aesthetics because the journal was focusing on art and culture(s).

                            I created a password-protected website as a prototype to share with stakeholders, who shared feedback.

                            I built the Infinite Mile website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, MailChimp, VideoJS and WowSlider.  
                            Later, I added APIs for events using EventBrite and to handle sales of annual print anthologies and merchandise using PayPal.

                            User tests were conducted for the Infinite Mile website.  
                            Google Chrome Developer was used to test the code.

                    Setting the direction for the Infinite Mile website was a challenge.  
                    Many discussions about whether or not to create a custom website or use WordPress were had.  
                    Procedures to change the website lacked a formal process.  
                    The website was missing key functionality like responsiveness.

                    Infinite Mile was a huge success and some of the most rewarding work I have done in my life.  
                    Infinite Mile was an important lesson in how web programs can bring communities together.  
                    As a result, I decided to deeply learn web development and UX design.
