            content: "Yes, one of the things I love about my career is working with other software developers.  I worked on teams that blended UX design with software development, teams that were strictly software development and teams that worked across all departments.  I enjoy seeing how each software developer is unique and learning from each software developerâ€™s experience.  My skills having led companies lend themselves to collaboration.  As someone with a background in higher education, I also share a passion for sharing knowledge."

            content: `The process I use for software development can vary depending on the project.   When I am designing software, I typically use a 5-stage design process.  The five stages are (1) empathize, (2) define, (3) iterate, (4) test and (5) prototype.
              When I am developing software for clients, I typically am in frequent contact with the client over the course of a project.  I will show the client progress on the project in stages to make desired changes before they become too costly to make.  At Art in Tech Services, I write agreements that help set expectations for projects between the company and the client.`

To learn new technologies, I regularly enroll in online courses, read articles and talk to other developers and UX designers.  The research skills I gained in higher education help with learning new developments in the fields of UX design and software development."
